## Academic Options 

### Jekyll Scholar 
*Excerpt from [Jekyll-Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar)*
> Jekyll-Scholar is for all the academic bloggers out there. It is a set of extensions to Jekyll, the awesome, blog aware, static site generator; it formats your bibliographies and reading lists for the web and gives your blog posts citation super-powers.  


## Theme Options 

## Blog Settings 

### Blog Page Settings   

The main blog page uses Bootstrap 4 Cards to preview individual blog posts. There are several different types of preview styles available. Set the preview by changing the frontmatter on the post *.md file in the `_posts` directory. The current available options are below.  

|   Option       |   Syntax       |  Description       |   Preview  |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|
| card-img-top  | `card-img-top`  |  Image on top      |            |
| card-dated    | `card-dated`    |  Shows Date        |            |
| card-no-img   | `card-no-img`   |  No Header Image   |            |





### Favicon 

Site favicons are located at `/assets/img/icons`. You can use a [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create a new set of icons using any image you'd like. Simply create a package from the aboved linked generator and replace the icons folder.
